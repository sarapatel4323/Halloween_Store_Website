                    <h4>This year's story:<br>"The Benevolent Goblin"</h4>
                    <p id="caption">by Gesta Romanorum </p>
                    
                    <p>In the kingdom of England there is a hillock in the midst of a dense wood. Thither in old days
                        knights and their followers were wont to repair when tired and thirsty after the chase. When one
                        of their number called out, "I thirst!" there immediately started up a Goblin with a cheerful
                        countenance, clad in a crimson robe, and bearing in his outstretched hand a large drinking-horn
                        richly ornamented with gold and precious jewels, and full of the most delicious, unknown
                        beverage.</p>

                    <p>The Goblin presented the horn to the thirsty knight, who drank and instantly felt refreshed and
                        cool. After the drinker had emptied the horn, the Goblin offered a silken napkin to wipe the
                        mouth. Then, without waiting to be thanked, the strange creature vanished as suddenly as he had
                        come.</p>

                    <p> once there was a knight of churlish nature, who was hunting alone in those parts. Feeling
                        thirsty and fatigued, he visited the hillock and cried out:</p>

                    <p> "I thirst!"</p>

                    <p> the Goblin appeared and presented the horn.</p>

                    <p> the knight had drained it of its delicious beverage, instead of returning the horn, he
                        thrust it into his bosom, and rode hastily away.</p>

                    <p> He boasted far and wide of his deed, and his feudal lord hearing thereof caused him to be bound
                        and cast into prison; then fearing lest he, too, might become partaker in the theft and
                        ingratitude of the knight, the lord presented the jeweled horn to the King of England, who
                        carefully preserved it among the royal treasures. But never again did the benevolent Goblin
                        return to the hillock in the wood.</p>
